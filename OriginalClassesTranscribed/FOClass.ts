//VB-Dev Notes:
//For the purposes of structural steel, all numeric values are in inches for now. Previous declarations of height and
//width as integers remain as legacy. New declarations as double probably unnecessary - integers should suffice
//Possible FO types for structural steel: "PDoor","OHDoor","Window","MiscFO"
